What Is a Through Line in Writing?

A through line, sometimes written as “through-line” or 
“throughline,” connects themes and story structure 
in short stories, books, playscripts, and screenplays.
 Novelists, screenwriters, and playwrights might build a through
  line off recurring motifs, character traits,
   or even external plot points.
A through line can maintain and clarify the audience’s attention, offering readers and viewers thematic and character insights.

The primary through line 
concerns the main character 
and might manifest as a hero’s 
journey or 
other narrative exploration. 
As story elements, through lines do not only pertain to protagonists.
Through lines can also be essential to subplots, letting audiences and readers track
supporting characters’ arcs.
Stories can have two, three, four, or more subplot through lines to help create complex narratives.
